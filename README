This reference design contains the following contents:

1. accelerators

   This folder contains the Vitis accelerator project for the Accelerated
   Application 1 (AA1). It consists of the DPU inference engine IP and a
   pre-processing kernel based on the Vitis Vision libraries. Follow the
   README inside this folder for detailed build instructions.

2. libraries

   This folder contains the Intelligent Video Analytics SDK (IVAS) and Vitis AI
   (VAI) software libraries. Follow the README files in the respective
   sub-folders for build instructions.

   Note: The libraries are included as prebuilt binaries inside the petalinux
         BSP, therfore building this libraries from source is optional. If you
         wish to build them from source, the PetaLinux SDK must be built first,
         see PetaLinux README for instructions on bulding the SDK.

3. Makefile

   Top-level Makefile for building the AA1 Vitis accelerator project, importing
   the resulting build artifacts into the Petalinux project, and building a
   complete SD card image using the Petalinux tool. Type make or make help to
   print the help text explaining the different make targets.

4. petalinux

   This folder contains the PetaLinux project for the smartcamera platform. It
   is used to build the SD card image and Petalinux SDK, a complete cross-build
   environment. Follow the README inside this folder for build instructions.

5. platforms

   This folder contains the KV260 smartcamera Vitis platform. Follow the REAMDE
   for instructions on how to open the underlying Vivado hardware design.

6. README

   This file.

7. sdcard

   This folder contains a prebuilt SD card image, an xsdb tcl script for
   selecting SD boot mode, and the AA1 application README file.
